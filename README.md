# text_based_adventure_game
This is one of my first projects. This is a game called "robot mayhem" where the user has to choose between two options in order to complete the story.
I made this program in order to practice functions and conditional logic. The story based on a short story I made up for fun. The program takes the user input, and if the input is incorrect (except the first two input when the story begin) it exits.
